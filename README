Take Home Exercise
NASA Pictures app

Instructions

Your task is to create an Android app that will let the user browse through a list of images parsed from a JSON file.
The JSON file can be found here.

Make a git repository for the project and send this to us once you are done.
Write code incrementally, make multiple commits, just like you would in a real project.

The app should build directly using Android Studio or any other IDE of your choice, and the command line.

Please make a note to not share this repository with anyone outside Obvious.

Screens

1. Images Grid Screen

This is the home screen. When it launches, show a scrollable grid of pictures starting with the latest images first.
When the user taps on an image that should open the image detail screen.


2. Image Detail Screen

This screen displays the full size image along with the metadata like title, description, etc.
The user should also be able to swipe through images.

We will evaluate the master branch unless otherwise specified.
Feel free to use any open source libraries that youâ€™d like.
